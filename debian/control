Description: forces Gokien overlay for some packages
 This package forces some patched packages to be installed from a ppa instead
 of using the latest version available.
 .
 The packages in elementary PPA have greater version than those in Ubuntu
 most of the time, but the patching might lag several hours behind Ubuntu
 archive. This package exists to prevent upgrading to unpatched packages
 when such lag occurs.
